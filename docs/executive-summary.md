## 🚀 What Makes It Different

### 1. **AI Medical Coding** (94% Accuracy)
- Reads clinical notes in plain English
- Suggests correct ICD-10 and CPT codes automatically
- Your staff reviews and approves (not fully automatic)
- **Result**: 60% faster coding, 70% fewer coding errors

**Example**: Doctor dictates *"Patient presents with acute low back pain radiating to left leg. Performed lumbar spine manipulation."*
- AI suggests: ICD-10 M54.5 (Low back pain), CPT 98940 (CMT, spinal manipulation)
- Biller confirms in 10 seconds vs. 5 minutes manual coding

### 2. **Smart Payment Matching** (92% Auto-Match)
- Automatically matches insurance payments to claims
- Handles bulk EOBs, zero-balance accounts, partial payments
- **Result**: 92% auto-matched vs. 60-70% industry average

### 3. **Attorney Lien Portal** (Unique Feature)
- Secure portal for legal/PI cases
- Real-time balance lookups, online payments
- Automatic lien reduction calculations
- **Result**: 40% faster legal claim resolution, 30% higher recovery

### 4. **Real-Time Analytics**
- Days in A/R, denial rates, payer performance - live dashboard
- Identify problems before they cost you money
- Mobile app for on-the-go monitoring

### 5. **2-3 Day Setup**
- Not months of implementation
- No "big bang" cutover
- Works alongside your existing system initially

## 📋 How It Works (Simple Version)

```
1. Doctor sees patient → Writes note in EMR
   ↓
2. NexClinical AI reads note → Suggests codes
   ↓
3. Your biller reviews (10 sec) → Submits claim
   ↓
4. Insurance pays → System auto-matches payment
   ↓
5. Patient billed automatically → Portal for payment
   ↓
6. Dashboard shows: collected $X, $Y pending, $Z denied
```

**Your Staff's Role**: Review AI suggestions, handle exceptions, manage denials (not data entry)

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Will this replace my billing staff?**  
A: No. It makes them more efficient. Most practices reduce staff through attrition or reassign to higher-value work (denial management, patient calls). Small practices can go from 2 FTE to 1 FTE.

**Q: How accurate is the AI coding?**  
A: 94.2% for ICD-10, 91.8% for CPT codes. Your staff always reviews before submission. It's "assisted coding" not "autonomous coding."

**Q: What if it makes a mistake?**  
A: Your biller catches it during review. If a mistake gets through (rare), we have E&O insurance and audit protection. You're never liable for AI suggestions.

**Q: Do I need to change my EMR?**  
A: No. We integrate with most EMRs or work standalone. You keep your clinical workflow.

**Q: What about my current billing company?**  
A: You can keep them and use NexClinical as their tool (saves them time = saves you money). Or transition in-house with 1-2 staff + our system.

**Q: What's the catch?**  
A: Honest answer: Works best with practices doing >200 claims/month. Below that, cost/benefit is marginal. Also requires decent clinical documentation (garbage in = garbage out).
